# CodSoft Python Internship

This repository contains the work completed as part of the **CodSoft Python Programming Internship**.  
The internship focused on building strong Python fundamentals and understanding the practical application of Machine Learning concepts through hands-on projects.

## Tasks and Projects Included

### Basic Python Projects
1. Password Generator  
2. Simple Calculator  
3. To-Do List Application  

These projects were developed to strengthen core Python concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and file handling.

### Machine Learning Project
4. Student Performance Prediction System Using Python and Machine Learning  

This project applies basic Machine Learning techniques to predict student academic performance based on historical data such as study hours, attendance, and previous scores.  
Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Tree were used for model training and prediction.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  

## Note
All projects in this repository were developed for **learning and academic purposes** as part of the CodSoft Internship.
