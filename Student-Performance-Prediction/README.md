# Student Performance Prediction System

This project was developed as part of an Internship on Python and Machine Learning under CODSOFT.

## Objective
To predict student academic performance using Machine Learning techniques based on historical academic data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Description
The system uses student-related data such as study hours, attendance, and previous scores.
Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Tree are used to train the model and make predictions.

## How It Works
1. Data is loaded and preprocessed
2. Features are selected
3. Model is trained
4. Predictions are generated

## Note
This project is developed for educational and learning purposes.
